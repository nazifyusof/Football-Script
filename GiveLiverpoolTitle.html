                  <h1> Give Liverpool The Title Already! </h1>

                  <p>The 30 years of wait might just be over for Liverpool fans this time around.
                    With a game in hand and 13 points ahead of second place Leicester City, Liverpool’s
                    fate lies in their own hands. The way they are cruising past the league brushing aside
                    rivals, grinding wins even when they are not playing well, it seems very unlikely that
                    this Liverpool side will capitulate like their 2014 predecessors.</p>

                  <p>Still unbeaten in the league and had only dropped points against a plucky United side, Liverpool
                    might just end their PL title drought this season. One could be forgiven for wondering what had
                    happened to the other so called ‘Big 6’. The champions, battered and defeated for the fifth time
                    this season against a resilient Wolves side. Pep Guardiola’s team has suffered from the lack of
                    quality Center-Backs. Injury to John Stones and Aymeric Laporte had seen the ever versatile Fernandinho
                    fill in at the center of defense. It appears that other teams are starting to unravel Guardiola’s tactics,
                    and when they do he doesn’t seem to have the answers to solve it.</p>

                  <p>Spurs, a shadow of the side which reached the Champions League final last season, appeared to be
                    exhausted and out of ideas. Senior players who are not signing new contracts and disagreements with
                    the manager finally took its toll. Mauricio Pochettino was swiftly replaced by Jose Mourinho. Daniel
                    Levy must have been tempted by the availability of a proven winner. Spurs looked rejuvenated under a
                    new manager, and it seems Dele Alli has find his form again. The defense looks pretty leaky at the back,
                    Mourinho will definitely look for an alternative in the January window.</p>

                  <p>Given their recent transfer ban and that they had only just appointed Frank Lampard as manager before the
                    season started, Chelsea should be forgiven for their shortcomings this season. Lampard has done a great job
                    in blooding youngsters into the senior team, albeit the drop of form in recent weeks. The comeback against
                    Arsenal shows steel in character, which Chelsea’s young team has shown as their slowly progress in the league.
                    Chelsea find themselves still in the top four at new year. Tammy Abraham, Christian Pulisic and the surprising
                    resurgence of Willian has got Chelsea going this season.</p>

                  <p>At first glance it seemed that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer decision to not sign replacements for the outgoing Romelu Lukaku
                    and Alexis Sanchez was the biggest mistake United had made this season, but the return of Anthony Martial from injury
                    had United’s engine running again. This coincides with the rise of Fred’s and Scott McTominay’s partnership in United’s
                    midfield. Fred in particular, has finally looked like the midfielder United thought they had signed last season. His
                    performance against the star-studded Man City midfield was a sight to behold. For all their good performance this season,
                    United appears to have problems against sides that sit deep and hit on the counter-attack. United had lost or drawn almost
                    all the games where they dominated posession. Solksjaer would look to bolster his attacking midfielder options in the
                    January window, ones that could unlock tight defenses.</p>

                  <p>Arsenal being Arsenal. They do look different and more energized after the sacking of Unai Emery, but the same problems
                    resurfaced during the Chelsea game. The usually composed and reliable Bernd Leno made a mistake while trying to punch
                    the ball away, and this allowed for Chelsea to claw back into the game. Chelsea completely turned the game around three
                    minutes later with a good movement and also a good shot by Tammy Abraham, who scored Chelsea’s second goal of the game.
                    Arsenal per usual, looked porous at the back, and their defense crumbled under constant pressure from the Chelsea side.
                    Mikel Arteta’s appointment as their new manager does seemed to had an effect on their tactics though.</p>

                  <p>Arsenal now moves a lot more like a team while pressing and their forwards now helps a lot with defending, at some point Aubameyang
                    was constantly covering for the Left-Back. Although the game ended with a defeat, there are certainly positives that could be
                    taken from the game. Arteta’s arrival could perhaps save Arsenal’s season but there will be tonnes of work for him to do.</p>

                  <p>Leicester City are the surprise package of the season. Brendan Rodgers had his team punching way above their weight. After City’s
                    capitulation in recent weeks, neutrals were hoping for Leicester to put pressure on Liverpool in the title race but defeats against
                    City and Liverpool has put Rodger’s men 13 points behind the league leaders with an extra game played. The performance of Chilwell,
                    Vardy, Tielemans and Maddison has been a joy to watch throughout the first-half of the season. It will be interesting to see what this
                    team from Leicester has in-store for the rest of the season.</p>

                  <p>Of all the ‘Big 6’, it would appear that Liverpool and Man City are the best equipped team to fight for the league title but injuries
                    has taken it’s toll on City and albeit the race being interrupted by Leicester, it is implausible for Liverpool to lose foot on the title
                    race this time. Liverpool’s squad depth and also the presence of perhaps currently the best full-back duo who are rarely injured has
                    propelled Liverpool to the summit, and they aren’t looking back.</p>
