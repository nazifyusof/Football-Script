                  <h1> Fallen Giants </h1>

                  <p>The first shot on target of the game was in the 29th minute. It was also
                     the first shot on goal in the game for both sides. This speak volumes on how
                     far both teams have fallen. The game ended in a 1-1 draw. Points shared, a suitable
                     result for an abysmal game. Neither team deserved the full 3 points.</p>

                  <p>Both teams lacked the conviction to take control of the game. Manchester United’s
                      forward line were largely ineffective. Their midfield lacked the intensity to split open
                      the Arsenal side. Only a fast break, followed by a wonderful shot by Scott McTominay, were
                      they able to obtain the lead. Marcus Rashford looked a whole different player in recent weeks,
                      compared to the player who tore apart Chelsea in Gameweek 1. He looked unconfident and tired,
                      fluffing big chances throughout the game.</p>

                  <p>The fact that Jesse Lingard gets the nod ahead of Mason Greenwood baffles me. Lingard has
                    yet to score or assist in any Premier League games this calendar year and still manage to
                     start ahead of Greenwood who has been performing really well each time he is on the pitch.
                      Greenwood has 4 goals to his name with the senior squad, including the preseason friendlies.
                       He’s always a threat when playing and should have started against Arsenal. United’s lack of
                       experienced forwards was laid bare this time. Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku who left for
                        Inter Milan in the summer would have definitely gave a boost to the squad, at least a little
                        if not much.</p>
                  <p>Arsenal on the other side of the field were no different. Granit Xhaka was too slow, and the
                    midfield was too reliant on the young Matteo Guendouzi to play the box-to-box role and control
                    the midfield. The dynamic Lucas Torreira without a doubt has the ability to create chances but
                     was kept quiet by McTominay all game. Arsenal’s lack of a commanding voice in their back-line
                     has also left something for their manager, Unai Emery, to ponder. No one tracked McTominay in
                     the movement which lead to the first goal of the game.</p>

                  <p>The addition of David Luiz was greeted with cheers in the summer, but he looked more of a
                    liability in the game. Luiz almost gave United a penalty when he made a rash tackle, which
                    completely misses the ball, at the edge of the box in the 90th minute. Nicolas Pepe seemed
                    too eager to justify his £72 million price tag and wasted multiple clear-cut chances. Arsenal’s
                    only goal came in the 58th minute when United’s left-back of the day, Axel Tuanzebe, mishit a back
                    pass too strong that got to the foot of Bukayo Saka who’s through pass was slotted home by Pierre-Emerick
                    Aubameyang. Tuanzebe had been solid all-game but his first mistake led to a goal for Arsenal.</p>

                  <p>Both Manchester United and Arsenal didn’t seemed to had any clear tactics in their approach to the game.
                    United had more possession of the ball overall but didn’t really do anything with it. Too many safe side-passes
                    never threatened the Arsenal ranks. United were content with moving the ball side to side and this style of
                    play didn’t stretch the Arsenal players enough for United’s forwards to be able to make anything happen.
                    Arsenal relied on their pacy forwards from the start but United’s defense perservered.</p>

                  <p>This game was one of the worst performance from both sides ever. It was full of sloppy passes, mistimed shots,
                    mistimed tackles, poor pressing when off the ball, poor back-tracking when defending and poor ball retention.
                    Both teams didn’t had any direction to how they wanted to play the game out. Most of the time after dribbling
                    some distance, players looked lost and didn’t know how to proceed when they were rushed by defenders. A stark
                    contrast to Manchester City and Liverpool who are well drilled in both attack and defense. The lack of quality
                    in the Arsenal and Manchester United squads, as compared to the Liverpool and Manchester City squads are alarming.</p>

                  <p>A battle between United and Arsenal used to be the title decider, the game changer that would shape how a season would
                    end. Nowadays it is really just a fight to remain relevant, in an era where Liverpool and City are the true elites. It
                    is honestly sad to see how far these clubs who ruled the 2000s have fallen. The post-Ferguson era hasn’t been kind to
                    United, while Arsenal has been toppled by their North London neighbors in recent years. United now lavish at 10th place
                    and Arsenal at 4th. With how things are going, it wouldn’t be long until they are too much behind the league leaders both
                    in terms of points and development.</p>
