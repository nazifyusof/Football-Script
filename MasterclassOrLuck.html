                  <h1> Pochettino Masterclass or Luck? </h1>

                  <p>The referee blows his whistle and it’s all over. Tottenham Hotspurs
                    have done it! They have held the champions to a draw at the Etihad Stadium!
                    Manchester City will rue their missed chances as they fail to convert any
                    after the Spurs equalizer. Do not be mistaken by the score line though. Spurs
                    were definitely the second-best team today. Pochettino’s men were thoroughly
                    overwhelmed in every department. They were completely overrun by City in the first
                    half. To give more insight on this, Spurs first serious possession of the ball of the
                    game came only in the 8th minute after surviving a couple of City’s onslaught.</p>

                  <p>Manchester City had a total of 30 shots all game with 10 on target against Spurs’ three.
                    Only two of Spurs’ shots were on target and both resulted in a goal. Harry Kane was
                    isolated most of the game as the midfield comprised of Harry Winks, Tanguy Ndombele,
                    Moussa Sissoko, Erik Lamela and Christian Eriksen failed to provide any sort of service
                    to their top striker. This was the result of City’s masterclass in pressing and movements
                    when off the ball. The City team has this unique shape when on the field where the center-backs
                    and the central midfielders would position themselves narrowly and interchange passes while the
                    full-backs and wingers stay wide and high. This allows smooth passing in midfield while retaining
                    quick counterattack movements through the wings.<p>

                  <p>Without Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura in the starting 11, Spurs lack of pace was evident as
                    City passed the ball around their team without much difficulty. Without any pace in pressing,
                    it was almost impossible for Spurs to regain possession from the perfectly drilled Manchester
                    City team. It was also impossible to launch any counter attacks even when City’s team were playing
                    a very high defensive line. Since no one in the Spurs was making runs in behind City’s defenses, it
                    was easy for City to maintain their defensive shape. Having either Son or Moura in the first half
                    would have helped spread City’s defenders thus creating space for other Spurs players to exploit.</p>

                  <p>Spurs tried playing out from the back and more than a couple of times did they almost paid for it. In
                    the first half, Manchester City exploited Spurs’ right-side which was defended by Kyle Walker-Peters.
                    More often than not City had Raheem Sterling playing on the shoulders of the young right-back and had
                    either Olexandr Zinchenko or one of City’s three midfielders cutting inside to pull the right-back out
                    of position. City’s tactics of interchanging wingers also seemed to confuse the Tottenham Hotspurs players
                    a lot as Sterling and Bernardo Silva were allowed to free roam in the build-up to the final third of the field. </p>

                  <p>It felt like Manchester City had this game in hand when Sterling headed in a Kevin De Bruyne
                    cross in the 20th minute, only for Erik Lamela to equalize two minutes later. The goal came in a
                    period where the City players seemed to put their foot off the gas as they allowed Spurs some possession
                    of the ball before Lamela, seeing Ederson someway off his line, bends a beautiful finesse shot into the net.
                    City responded 12 minutes later when De Bruyne’s sublime low cross finds Sergio Aguero in the 6-yard box.</p>

                  <p>When Lucas Moura was brought on in place of Winks, it was obvious that Pochettino wasn’t going to back down
                    easily, and the change worked marvelously. While City still has the upper hand most of the time, City’s backline
                    at least, are constantly under pressure from Moura’s pressing. Moura’s introduction into the game also meant that
                    City’s fullbacks now need to worry about those speedy counter attacks that beat Ajax in last season’s Champions
                    League semi-final. Even if it is not much, having to worry about counter attacks would definitely hinder any
                    fullback from going forward, at least a bit if not much. Now that the fullbacks are somewhat restricted, City’s
                    wing play became less effective than in the first half.</p>

                  <p>Raheem Sterling was generally quiet in the second half, so was Bernardo Silva. City constantly tested the
                    Spurs’ keeper and hit the bar once but never managed to find the winning goal. Even the introduction of the
                    on form Riyad Mahrez 10 minutes from time failed to get Manchester City their much needed win. The Etihad
                    Stadium roared to life when it seemed like Gabriel Jesus had scored the winning goal in the 94th minute, but
                    that goal was eventually disallowed by VAR as Aymeric Laporte’s hand touched the ball in the build-up to the
                    shot. City will hate themselves for not burying the game earlier when they had the chance to.</p>

                  <p>City definitely could have done better, but Spurs’ unshakable resolve to defend and score where their opponent
                    least expected is also commendable. Coupled with a bit of luck, and poor finishing on City’s half, Spurs’ managed
                    to take a point from the current England champions in an away game. To City, this was a small snag in their attempt
                    to defend their title. To other title challengers, this is a game of what ifs. Other coaches would look forward to exploit
                    this as a chance to go toe to toe with Guardialo’s men in the future.  </p>
